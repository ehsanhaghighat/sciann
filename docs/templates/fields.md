# Fields

`Field` is a layer to define outputs of each Functional. It is very much similar to Keras' `Dense` layer. 

It is not necessary to be defined explicitly, however, if you are expecting multiple outputs, it is better to be defined using `Field`.  

```python
from sciann import Field

Fx = Field(10, name='Fx')
```
