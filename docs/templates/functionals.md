# Functionals

A combination of neural network layers form a `Functional`. 

Mathematically, a `functional` is a general mapping from space \\(X\\) into some output space \\(Y\\). Once the parameters of this transformation are found, this mapping is called a `function`. 

`Functional`s are needed to form `SciModels`. 

A `Functional` is a class to form complex architectures (mappings) from inputs (`Variables`) to the outputs. 


```python
from sciann import Variable, Functional

x = Variable('x')
y = Variable('y')

Fxy = Functional('Fxy', [x, y], 
                 hidden_layers=[10, 20, 10],
                 activation='tanh')
```

`Functionals` can be plotted when a `SciModel` is formed. A minimum of one `Constraint` is needed to form the SciModel

```python
from sciann.conditions import Data
from sciann import SciModel

model = SciModel(x, Data(Fxy), 
                 plot_to_file='output.png')
```
